# Colorize

The Colorize library is a Dart-based input type='color' Polyfill and a custom
element color picker. It is based off of the original works by 
[Code Respawn](https://github.com/coderespawn) found from the original 
[dart-color-picker](https://github.com/coderespawn/dart-color-picker)

Usage details soon to follow.
